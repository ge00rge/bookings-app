Project for booking trips:

Built with NodeJs, Express, Mongo, JS, HTML and CSS

Relies heavily on MVC architecture where front end code gets rendered in the server side.

In case of use you will not receive confirmation mails because
Sendgrid is not implemented as it is required a business mail
and I did not shared it.
