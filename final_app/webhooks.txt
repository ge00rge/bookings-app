 In stripe --> webhooks:

 we're gonna specify a URL here to which Stripe will automatically send 
 a POST request to whenever a checkout session has successfully completed
 (whenever a payment was successful)
 
 With that POST request, Stripe will then send back the original session 
 data that we created in the first step when we created that checkout session.
